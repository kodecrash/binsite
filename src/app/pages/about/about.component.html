                    There is no mention of Angular versions, but shouldn't this be as simple as adding the bootstrap

                    the

                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's
                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                    scrambled it
                    to
                    make
                    a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                    typesetting,
                    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                    containing
                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                    including
                    versions
                    of Lorem Ipsum.
